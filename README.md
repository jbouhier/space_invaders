Project Space Invaders
### etna-alternance.net - Software Engineerers - promotion March 2017

This is the last C project of our 1st year at ETNA after programming the Linux commands ls, cat and C printf function.
This is a remake with lib SDL 2.0 of classics retro games:

- Space Invaders (1978)
- Galaga (1981)
- R-Type (1987)  


## For each game, we have to implement the follwing functionalities:
- Space Invaders: a ship able to move and shoot, one type of enemy moving in one dimention and able to shoot, a print of the score and a save of the hi-score, player life management and to finish a game over.  
    
- Galaga: all of the above plus an animated background, enemies with more evolved mouvements of differents types (apparence and capabilities).  
  
- R-Type with again all of the above, scrolling horizontal or vertical, ship bonuses, boss at the end of the level and any other bonus we can imagine.
